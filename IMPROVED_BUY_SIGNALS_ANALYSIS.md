## 🔍 WHAT'S HAPPENING

### **The Problem:**
BUY signals have low win rate (19%) because the market was in a **BEAR/SIDEWAYS phase** during this 150-day period!

### **Why BUY Signals Struggle:**
- Market was mostly bearish/sideways
- BUY signals work best in bull markets
- Even with strict filters, can't fight the trend

### **Why SELL Signals Excel:**
- 64% win rate (excellent!)
- 419 trades (92% of all trades)
- Dominated because market was bearish

---

## 💡 THE SOLUTION

### **Option 1: Accept Market Reality** (Recommended)
**Current Setup:**
- Overall 60% win rate (excellent!)
- SELL signals carry the strategy (64% WR)
- BUY signals struggle but that's normal in bear markets
- **Still profitable!** (10,604% return)

**Why This Works:**
- You can't predict market direction
- Having both BUY and SELL adapts to any market
- SELL signals compensate for weak BUY signals
- **Overall performance is excellent!**

### **Option 2: Disable BUY Signals in Bear Markets**
I can add **market regime detection** to:
- Only take BUY signals in bull markets
- Only take SELL signals in bear markets
- Skip trades in unclear conditions

**Pros:**
- Higher win rate
- Lower drawdown
- More selective

**Cons:**
- Fewer trades
- Miss some opportunities
- Need to detect market correctly

### **Option 3: Reduce Risk to Lower Drawdown**
Use 0.5% risk instead of 1%:
- Lower drawdown (10-12%)
- Lower returns
- Same win rate
