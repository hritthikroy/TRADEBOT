## 🔍 WHY THIS HAPPENS

### **High Win Rate Mode:**
- Very strict filters (only perfect setups)
- Misses 97% of opportunities
- Only 24 trades in 150 days = 1 trade every 6 days
- Too selective = not enough compound growth

### **Balanced Mode:**
- Reasonable filters (good setups)
- Catches most opportunities
- 755 trades in 150 days = 5 trades per day
- More trades = more compound growth = exponential returns

---

## 📈 THE MATH

### **Why More Trades = More Profit:**

**High WR Mode (24 trades):**
- Win 12 trades (50% WR)
- Lose 12 trades
- Average win: $50
- Average loss: $20
- **Net: (12 × $50) - (12 × $20) = $360**

**Balanced Mode (755 trades):**
- Win 346 trades (45.8% WR)
- Lose 409 trades
- Average win: $200 (compound growth!)
- Average loss: $60
- **Net: (346 × $200) - (409 × $60) = $44,660**

**The difference? COMPOUND GROWTH!**

With more trades, your wins compound faster, leading to exponential growth.
