### What Professional Traders Would Say

> "34.73% win rate? That's terrible. You need at least 40%, ideally 45%+."

> "0.76 profit factor means you're losing money. This isn't a strategy, it's a money burner."

> "167 trades in 30 days? You're overtrading by 2x. Quality over quantity!"

> "82.6% of trades hit stop loss? Your entry timing is completely off."

> "-0.43% return? After fees and slippage, you'd lose even more. This is not tradeable."
