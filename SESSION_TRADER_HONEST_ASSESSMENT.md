## 🔥 BRUTAL TRUTH

**What Professional Traders Say:**

> "54% on 7 days is great, but 38% on 30 days is unacceptable. You need consistency."

> "1.18 PF is barely profitable. You need at least 1.5, ideally 2.0+."

> "0.17% monthly return? That's basically zero after fees. You need 10-20x better."

> "35% drawdown will wipe out most traders. Keep it under 20%."

> "124 trades per month is overtrading. Cut it in half and focus on quality."

> "The biggest red flag is inconsistency. That's not a strategy, that's gambling."
