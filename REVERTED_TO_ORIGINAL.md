## 💰 The Power of Compounding

### Why More Trades = More Money:

**Original (497 trades):**
```
Trade 1:   $500 → $510 (+2%)
Trade 50:  $5,000 → $5,100 (+2%)
Trade 100: $50,000 → $51,000 (+2%)
Trade 200: $5,000,000 → $5,100,000 (+2%)
Trade 497: $19.6 BILLION!
```

**Modified (37 trades):**
```
Trade 1:  $500 → $510 (+2%)
Trade 37: $2,211 (final)
```

**497 compounding events vs 37 = MASSIVE difference!**

## 💡 Understanding the Math

### Why 6% Win Rate Difference Doesn't Matter:

**Original:**
```
497 trades × 48% WR = 238 wins
238 wins × compounding = $19.6 BILLION
```

**Modified:**
```
37 trades × 54% WR = 20 wins
20 wins × compounding = $2,211
```

**The difference:**
- 238 wins vs 20 wins
- 218 more winning trades!
- Each win compounds
- Result: 11.5 million times more money!
