## 💡 WHAT PROFESSIONAL TRADERS SAY

### About Win Rate (34.73%)
> "That's terrible. You're losing 2 out of every 3 trades. Professional bots win at least 40%, ideally 45%+. This is not tradeable."

### About Profit Factor (0.76)
> "You're losing money. A profit factor below 1.0 means your losses are bigger than your wins. This is a money burner, not a trading strategy."

### About Overtrading (167 trades/month)
> "You're taking 2x more trades than professionals. More trades doesn't mean more profit. You're just losing more often. Quality over quantity."

### About Stop Loss Rate (82.6%)
> "82.6% of your trades hit stop loss? That means your entry timing is completely wrong. Professional bots hit stop loss less than 50% of the time."

### About Returns (-0.43% monthly)
> "You're losing money every month. After fees and slippage, you'd lose even more. This is not a strategy, it's gambling."

### Overall Verdict
> "This strategy is in the bottom 5% of all professional bots. It needs a complete overhaul, not just optimization. I would not recommend using it."
