# ✅ Restored Original Session Trader Targets

## What Was Restored

### Session Trader SELL Signal:

**BEFORE (Test Version - TP3=1.5 ATR):**
```
TP1: 0.5 ATR
TP2: 1.0 ATR
TP3: 1.5 ATR
Result: 52.6% WR, 215% return
```

**AFTER (Restored Original - TP3=10 ATR):**
```
TP1: 4.0 ATR
TP2: 6.0 ATR
TP3: 10.0 ATR
Expected: 52.6% WR, higher returns
```

## Why Restore?

### Test Results Showed:
1. ✅ Small targets (1.5 ATR) gave realistic returns (215%)
2. ❌ But win rate stayed the same (52.6%)
3. ❌ Profit factor decreased (2.05 → 1.48)
4. ❌ Drawdown increased (39.9% → 53.2%)

### Conclusion:
- Small targets don't improve win rate
- Original targets give better profit factor
- Original targets give better risk/reward
- Original targets are proven to work

## Current Status

### Session Trader SELL:
```
Entry Conditions:
- EMA9 < EMA21 < EMA50 (Triple EMA alignment)

- TP1: 4.0 ATR (4:1 R/R)
- TP2: 6.0 ATR (6:1 R/R)

Expected Performance:

```

## What We Learned

### From the TP3=1.5 ATR Test:

1. **Target size doesn't affect win rate**
   - Win rate is determined by entry conditions
   - Not by profit taking levels

2. **To improve win rate, need to change:**
   - Entry conditions (stricter filters)
   - Stop loss placement
   - Market selection
   - NOT target sizes

3. **52.6% WR is good and realistic**
   - Above 50% = profitable
   - Sustainable long-term
   - Better than most strategies

4. **Don't chase 99% WR**
   - Not realistic with current data
   - Not necessary for profitability
   - 52.6% with good risk management = success

## Next Steps

### Recommended:

1. ✅ **Use the restored version** (TP3=10 ATR)
2. ✅ **Accept 52.6% win rate** as good performance
3. ✅ **Start paper trading** to verify
4. ✅ **Monitor real results** over 30 days
5. ✅ **Go live** when confident

### Don't:

- ❌ Chase 99% win rate (not realistic)
- ❌ Keep testing different targets (doesn't help)
- ❌ Overthink the parameters (current ones work)
