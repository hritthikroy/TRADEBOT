## 🔍 Why Low Returns Happen

### 1. Choppy Market
```
Price Movement: ↗↘↗↘↗↘ (sideways)
Trend: None
Volatility: Low
Result: Small moves, small profits
```

### 2. Low Volatility
```
When market doesn't move much:
- Small price swings
- Tight ranges
- Limited profit potential
- Even winning trades make little
```

### 3. No Strong Trends
```
Strategy works best in:
✅ Strong uptrends (big BUY profits)
✅ Strong downtrends (big SELL profits)

Current market:
❌ Sideways/choppy (small profits)
```

The market is just not giving us much to work with right now.

This is normal in trading. Not every week is profitable. Not every month is exciting.

**The key is:**
- Don't force trades
- Don't increase risk
- Be patient
- Wait for better conditions

**When the market starts trending again, you'll see:**
- 0.04% → 2% → 5% per week
- Same strategy
- Better conditions
- Bigger profits

**Until then:**
- Keep paper trading
- Build experience
- Learn the system
- Be ready

**Remember: Slow and steady wins the race. 🐢**

**Better to make 0.04% safely than lose 5% trying to force profits. 💪**
